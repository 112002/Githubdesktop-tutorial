# Welcome to GitHub Desktop!

This is your README. READMEs are where you can communicate what your project is and how to use it.

# Some important things about GITHUB Desktop
Start a project

You’ll find all the projects you’re working on listed in the sidebar. If you’re starting a new project, use the repository drop down menu to create a new repository or clone an existing one directly from GitHub.com.

Branch off

Branches are essential to proposing changes and reviewing code on GitHub—and they’re always available in the top left corner of the repository view. Just select the current branch to switch branches or create a new one.

Craft the perfect commit

View a diff of your uncommitted changes, and form the perfect commit by selecting the files—or even the specific lines—that make up a change. Enter the summary and description, then commit.

See your history

Visualize your changes and commits in the comparison graph. You can select commits on the graph to navigate through the history of your local branches.

Create a pull request

Once you’re happy with your commits, you can open a pull request for review and discussion without leaving GitHub Desktop or touching the command line.

Merge and deploy

Browse commits on local and remote branches to quickly and clearly see what changes still need to be merged. You can also merge your code to the master branch for deployment right from the app.

What's New:

Two-factor authentication codes sent via text message now support the origin-bound draft standard. This standard makes such codes easier for phones and other devices to parse and more phishing resistant by limiting the domains to which the device will prompt to autofill the one-time code.
